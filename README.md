# Single Player Squash game



## Introduction

This game is the first project in the first module of Ironhacks Full Stack Developer Program.


The goal was to create a game and indicate progress through a score.
A challenge was to use canvas and classes to realize this for me.

## Future work

- Improve design

  - Nicer point display

  - High score list

  - Paddle at 'high speed' almost leave the canvas


- Improve features

  - shift up levels at certain point score (more speed)

  - make it possible to 'slide' the ball to change angle on the return
